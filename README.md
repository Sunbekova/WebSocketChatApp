# ChatApp

A simple Android demo application that integrates and launches a chat interface via the [WebSocket Chat Library](https://github.com/Sunbekova/WebSocket-Chat-library). The chat is initiated through a reusable `ChatLauncher` and demonstrates modular design and clean architecture using an external chat module.

## Features

- Minimal, clean UI using ConstraintLayout
- One-tap launch to embedded WebSocket-based chat activity
- Powered by [websocketchatlibrary](https://github.com/Sunbekova/WebSocket-Chat-library)
- MVVM and modern Android practices in the library
